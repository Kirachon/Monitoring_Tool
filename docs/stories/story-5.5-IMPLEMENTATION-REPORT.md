# Story 5.5: Batch Certificate Generation - Implementation Report

## Overview
Implements batch certificate generation for multiple employees with per-item success/failure reporting, leveraging existing single-certificate generation pipeline.

## Backend
- Endpoint: `POST /api/certificates/batch-generate`
- Controller: `certificateController.batchGenerate` validates inputs and invokes service
- Service: `certificateService.batchGenerateCertificates({ employeeIds[], templateId, signatoryId })` iterates per employee and calls `generateCertificate` (with audit logging), returning results array
- Security: Requires `certificate.generate` permission; standard auth middleware enforced
- Error handling: Per-item try/catch to isolate failures; overall 200 response with detailed results

## Frontend
- View: `frontend/src/views/admin/CertificateBatchGenerate.vue` — select template, optional signatory, multiselect employees, run generation, see results, download PDFs
- Router: Added `/certificates/batch` (permission: `certificate.generate`)
- Service: `certificateService.batchGenerate(payload)`

## Notes
- Each successful item returns `{ id, referenceNo }`, enabling direct download using the existing download endpoint
- If you want a ZIP download of all PDFs, I can add it using a packaging library (requires permission to add a dependency)

## Testing Recommendations
- Unit: service batch path (success-only, mixed failures), input validation
- Integration: end-to-end batch; verify all successful items are persisted and downloadable
- UI/E2E: multiselect UX, large batch performance (50–100 employees), download buttons

## Status
✅ Completed. Acceptance criteria satisfied.
