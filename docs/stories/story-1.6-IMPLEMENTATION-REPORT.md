# Story 1.6 Implementation Report

**Story:** Password Management  
**Developer:** Alex (Dev Agent)  
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Actual Effort:** ~5 hours

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Verification

1. ‚úÖ "Change Password" link in user profile menu navigates to password change page
2. ‚úÖ Password change form displays fields: current password, new password, confirm new password
3. ‚úÖ PUT /api/auth/change-password endpoint validates current password, checks new password complexity
4. ‚úÖ Password complexity requirements enforced: minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character
5. ‚úÖ New password cannot match any of last 3 passwords (password history stored as hashes)
6. ‚úÖ Successful password change logs user out, requires re-login with new password
7. ‚úÖ Password expiration set to 90 days (configurable in system_config table)
8. ‚úÖ Users receive warning message 7 days before password expiration
9. ‚úÖ Expired passwords force password change on next login before accessing system
10. ‚úÖ Password change action logged to audit log
11. ‚úÖ Failed password change attempts (wrong current password) logged and count toward account lockout threshold

## üîë Key Features Implemented

### Backend Features

**Password Service:**
- changePassword() - Change user password with validation
- validatePasswordComplexity() - Enforce password complexity rules
- checkPasswordHistory() - Prevent password reuse (last 3 passwords)
- getPasswordStatus() - Get password expiration status
- calculatePasswordStrength() - Calculate password strength score (0-100)

**Password History:**
- Stores last 3 password hashes per user
- Prevents password reuse
- Automatic cleanup (keeps only last 3)

**Password Expiration:**
- 90-day expiration (configurable via system_config)
- Calculated on password change
- Checked on login
- Warning 7 days before expiration
- Force change on expiration

**Security:**
- Failed password change attempts increment failed_login_attempts
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-minute lockout)
- All password changes logged to audit log
- All sessions invalidated on password change (force re-login)
- Password complexity validation
- Password history validation

### Frontend Features

**Change Password View:**
- Current password field
- New password field
- Confirm password field
- Password show/hide toggles
- Password strength indicator (weak/medium/strong)
- Password requirements display
- Password expiration warning (7 days)
- Force change alert (expired)
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Success/error notifications

**Password Strength Indicator:**
- Visual progress bar
- Color-coded (red/yellow/green)
- Real-time calculation
- Based on length and character types

**User Experience:**
- "Change Password" link in user menu
- Automatic redirect if password expired
- Logout and re-login after password change
- Clear error messages
- Password requirements displayed

## üìù API Endpoints

### PUT /api/auth/change-password
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "currentPassword": "OldPass123!",
  "newPassword": "NewSecure456!",

- 400 Bad Request - PASSWORD_MISMATCH (new password and confirm don't match)

### GET /api/auth/password-status
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "passwordChangedAt": "2024-10-06T00:00:00Z",
