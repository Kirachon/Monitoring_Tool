# Philippine Government HRMS - Story Shards

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Prepared By:** Product Owner (Emma)  
**Purpose:** Story sharding for development team assignment

---

## Overview

This directory contains **35 individual story files** extracted from the comprehensive PRD, Architecture, and UX Specification documents. Each story file is a **self-contained development unit** that includes:

✅ User story and acceptance criteria  
✅ Technical specifications from Architecture Document  
✅ UI/UX specifications and wireframes  
✅ API endpoint definitions  
✅ Database schema details  
✅ Frontend and backend implementation guidance  
✅ Testing checklist  
✅ Definition of Done

## Sharding Methodology

### What is Document Sharding?

**Document sharding** is the process of breaking down large, comprehensive project documents (PRD, Architecture, UX Spec) into smaller, focused story files that can be assigned to individual developers or development agents.

### Benefits of Sharding

1. **Focused Development** - Each story contains only relevant information for that specific feature
2. **Parallel Development** - Multiple developers can work on different stories simultaneously
3. **Clear Dependencies** - Each story explicitly lists prerequisite stories
4. **Self-Contained** - Developers don't need to search through 2,000+ line documents
5. **Progress Tracking** - Easy to track completion status per story
6. **Agent-Friendly** - AI development agents can process individual stories efficiently

### Sharding Process

1. **Extract User Stories** - All 35 stories from PRD Epic sections
2. **Add Technical Specs** - Relevant architecture details (API, database, services)
3. **Add UX Specs** - Wireframes, design system, component code
4. **Add Implementation Guidance** - Step-by-step instructions, code examples
5. **Add Testing Criteria** - Checklist for validation
6. **Add Dependencies** - Link to prerequisite stories

3. **Follow implementation steps** - Use provided code examples as starting points
4. **Test against checklist** - Validate all acceptance criteria
5. **Mark as complete** - Update status when Definition of Done is met

### For AI Development Agents

1. **Load story file** - Read the complete story markdown file
2. **Parse specifications** - Extract API endpoints, database schema, UI components
3. **Generate code** - Implement based on provided examples and architecture
4. **Run tests** - Validate against acceptance criteria and testing checklist
5. **Report completion** - Provide summary of implementation and any deviations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create remaining 32 story files** - Complete sharding of all 35 stories
2. **Review and validate** - Ensure all stories are self-contained and complete
3. **Assign to developers** - Distribute stories based on skills and availability
