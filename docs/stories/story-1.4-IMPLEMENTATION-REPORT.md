# Story 1.4 Implementation Report

**Story:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
**Developer:** Alex (Dev Agent)  
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Actual Effort:** ~5 hours

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Verification

1. ‚úÖ Four roles defined in database: Employee, Supervisor, HR Administrator, System Administrator (created in Story 1.2 seed)
2. ‚úÖ Permissions defined for each module (29 permissions created in Story 1.2 seed)
3. ‚úÖ Role-permission mappings established (created in Story 1.2 seed)
4. ‚úÖ Authorization middleware checks user permissions before allowing access to protected routes
5. ‚úÖ Frontend UI conditionally renders menu items and buttons based on user role
6. ‚úÖ API endpoints return 403 Forbidden when user lacks required permission
7. ‚úÖ Users can be assigned multiple roles (supported by user_roles table)
8. ‚úÖ Permission checks log denied access attempts to audit log
9. ‚úÖ GET /api/auth/me endpoint returns current user profile with roles and permissions (implemented in Story 1.3)
10. ‚úÖ Role changes take effect on next login (JWT token contains roles/permissions)

## üîë Key Features Implemented

### Backend Features

**Audit Log Service:**
- Generic log() method for all audit events
- Specialized methods: logAuth, logAccessDenied, logCreate, logUpdate, logDelete, logApproval
- getLogs() with filtering capabilities
- Automatic JSON serialization of details
- Non-blocking (errors don't break application flow)

**Enhanced Authorization Middleware:**
- requireRole() - Check if user has specific role(s)
- requirePermission() - Check if user has specific permission(s)
- Automatic audit logging of access denials
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Comprehensive error codes

**Role-Permission Matrix (from Story 1.2 seed):**
- **Employee:** 7 permissions (basic access)
- **Supervisor:** 13 permissions (Employee + approvals)
- **HR Administrator:** 22 permissions (Supervisor + management)
- **System Administrator:** 29 permissions (all permissions)

### Frontend Features

**usePermissions Composable:**
- hasPermission(permission) - Check single permission
- hasRole(role) - Check single role
- hasAnyPermission(permissions[]) - Check if user has any of the permissions
- hasAllPermissions(permissions[]) - Check if user has all permissions
- hasAnyRole(roles[]) - Check if user has any of the roles
- hasAllRoles(roles[]) - Check if user has all roles
- Computed properties: isEmployee, isSupervisor, isHRAdmin, isSysAdmin
- Convenience computed: canApprove, canManageEmployees, canGenerateCertificates, canViewReports, hasSystemAccess

**NavigationDrawer Component:**
- Role-based menu items
- Collapsible rail mode
- User avatar and info
- Pending approvals badge (placeholder)
- Conditional rendering based on permissions
- Organized sections with dividers

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [x] Roles seeded correctly in database (Story 1.2)
- [x] Permissions seeded correctly (Story 1.2)
- [x] Role-permission mappings correct (Story 1.2)
- [x] Authorization middleware blocks unauthorized access
- [x] 403 Forbidden returned for insufficient permissions
- [x] Frontend conditionally renders based on permissions
- [x] Navigation menu shows/hides items correctly
- [x] Multiple roles supported (database schema allows)
- [x] Permission changes take effect on next login (JWT-based)
- [x] Denied access logged to audit log

## üìù Usage Examples

### Backend - Protecting Routes

```javascript
const { authenticate, requireRole, requirePermission } = require('../middleware/auth');

// Require authentication only
router.get('/profile', authenticate, profileController.get);

// Require specific role
router.get('/approvals', authenticate, requireRole('Supervisor'), approvalsController.list);

// Require specific permission
router.post('/employees', authenticate, requirePermission('employee.write'), employeeController.create);

// Require multiple permissions (any)
router.get('/reports', authenticate, requirePermission(['reports.view', 'system.admin']), reportsController.list);
```

### Frontend - Conditional Rendering

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Show to all authenticated users -->
  <v-btn>Dashboard</v-btn>
  
  <!-- Show only to users with permission -->
  <v-btn v-if="hasPermission('pass_slip.create')">
    Request Pass Slip
  </v-btn>
  
  <!-- Show only to supervisors and above -->
  <v-btn v-if="canApprove">
    Pending Approvals
  </v-btn>
  
  <!-- Show only to HR Administrators -->
  <v-btn v-if="canManageEmployees">
    Manage Employees
  </v-btn>
  
  <!-- Show only to System Administrators -->
  <v-btn v-if="hasSystemAccess">
    System Settings
  </v-btn>
</template>

<script setup>
import { usePermissions } from '@/composables/usePermissions'

const { 
  hasPermission, 
  canApprove, 
  canManageEmployees, 
  hasSystemAccess 
} = usePermissions()
</script>
```

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Roles and permissions seeded (Story 1.2)
- [x] Authorization middleware implemented (Story 1.3 + enhancements)
- [x] Audit logging service created
- [x] Access denials logged to audit log
- [x] Frontend permission composable created
- [x] Navigation drawer with role-based items
- [x] UI conditionally renders based on permissions
- [x] Ready for Story 1.5 (User Management)

## üîí Security Features

**Backend:**
- Permission checks on every protected route
- Audit logging of all access denials
- IP address and user agent tracking
- JWT token contains roles and permissions (no database lookup on every request)
- 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions
- Generic error messages (no permission hints)

**Frontend:**
- Conditional rendering prevents UI exposure
- Permission checks in composable
- Navigation items hidden based on permissions
- Backend validation ensures security (frontend is convenience only)

## üìä Audit Log Capabilities

**Logged Events:**
- Authentication (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Authorization (access denials)
- Entity operations (create, update, delete)
- Approvals (approve, deny)
- Custom events

**Audit Log Fields:**
- user_id - Who performed the action
- action - What action was performed
- module - Which module/feature
- entity_type - Type of entity affected
- entity_id - ID of entity affected
- details - Additional JSON details
- ip_address - Client IP
- user_agent - Client user agent
- created_at - Timestamp

**Story 1.4 Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Developer:** Alex (Dev Agent)  
**Completion Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Ready for:** Story 1.5 - User Management Interface

**Note:** RBAC system is fully implemented with 4 roles, 29 permissions, authorization middleware, audit logging, and frontend permission checking. All access control is enforced at both backend (security) and frontend (UX) levels.
