4. ✅ Department hierarchy supports unlimited nesting levels (e.g., Office → Division → Section → Unit)
5. ✅ "Edit Department" button allows modification of department name, parent, and department head
6. ✅ PUT /api/departments/:id endpoint updates department, prevents circular references (department cannot be its own ancestor)
