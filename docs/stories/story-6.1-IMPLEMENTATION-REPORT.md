## Known Limitations

1. **No Date Range Selector:** All time-based metrics use fixed periods (current month, last 7 days, etc.)
2. **No PDF Export:** Cannot export dashboard to PDF
3. **No Lazy Loading:** All widgets load simultaneously (may be slow with large datasets)
4. **Limited Clickability:** Only pending approvals widget is clickable
5. **No Widget Customization:** Cannot show/hide widgets or rearrange layout
6. **No Real-time Updates:** Relies on 5-minute auto-refresh, not WebSocket

## Testing Notes

**Manual Testing Required:**
1. Login as Employee - verify employee dashboard widgets
2. Login as Supervisor - verify supervisor dashboard widgets
3. Login as HR Administrator - verify HR admin dashboard widgets
4. Login as System Administrator - verify system admin dashboard widgets
5. Click refresh button - verify all widgets reload
6. Wait 5 minutes - verify auto-refresh occurs
7. Click "Pending Approvals" widget - verify navigation to approval queue
8. Resize browser - verify responsive layout

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Verify dashboard queries work
SELECT * FROM leave_balances LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM leave_requests WHERE status = 'Pending';
SELECT * FROM pass_slips WHERE status = 'Pending';
SELECT * FROM certificates;
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20;
```
