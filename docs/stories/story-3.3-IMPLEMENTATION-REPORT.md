- Overdue badge for pass slips exceeding expected time in + 30 minutes
- Duration column showing hours and minutes
- Actual time in column

7. ✅ Overdue pass slips appear in supervisor's dashboard with alert icon
8. ✅ Supervisor can record return time on behalf of employee if needed
9. ✅ Return time recording logged to audit log
10. ✅ Completed pass slips display duration: actual time in - time out (in hours and minutes)
