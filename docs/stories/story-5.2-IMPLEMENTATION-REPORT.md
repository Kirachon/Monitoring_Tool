**Epic:** 5 - Certificate Generation  
**Implemented By:** Dev Agent (Alex)  
**Date:** 2025-10-06

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive certificate generation system with employee selection, template selection, preview functionality, and PDF generation using Puppeteer. Certificates are automatically populated with employee data and stored with unique reference numbers.

---

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation

**Dependencies Added:**
- `puppeteer` (v21.6.1) - Headless Chrome for PDF generation

**Files Modified:**
1. `backend/src/services/certificateService.js` - Added generation methods
2. `backend/src/controllers/certificateController.js` - Added generation endpoints
3. `backend/src/routes/certificates.js` - Added generation routes

**New Service Methods:**
- `generateReferenceNumber()` - Creates unique CERT-YYYY-NNNN reference numbers
- `replacePlaceholders(template, data)` - Replaces {{placeholders}} with actual data
- `getEmployeeData(employeeId)` - Fetches employee and leave balance data
- `generateCertificate(params, userId, ip, userAgent)` - Main generation method
- `generatePDF(content, referenceNo)` - Converts HTML to PDF using Puppeteer

**API Endpoints Implemented:**
- `POST /api/certificates/preview` - Preview certificate with employee data
- `POST /api/certificates/generate` - Generate and save certificate PDF
- `GET /api/certificates/:id/download` - Download generated certificate

**PDF Generation:**
- Uses Puppeteer headless Chrome
- A4 format with 20mm margins
- Prints background colors/images
- Saves to `backend/certificates/` directory
- Filename format: `CERT-YYYY-NNNN.pdf`

**Data Population:**
- Employee name (first + middle + last)
- Employee ID
- Position
- Department
- Date hired (formatted as "January 1, 2025")
- Salary grade
- VL balance (from leave_balances table)
- SL balance (from leave_balances table)
- Current date (formatted)
- Signatory name and title

**Database Records:**
- Inserts record into `certificates` table
- Tracks: reference_no, employee_id, template_id, signatory_id, file_path_pdf, status, issued_date, issued_by
- Full audit logging

### Frontend Implementation

**Files Created:**
1. `frontend/src/views/admin/CertificateGenerate.vue` - Generation interface

**Files Modified:**
1. `frontend/src/services/certificateService.js` - Added generation API methods
2. `frontend/src/router/index.js` - Added generation route

**UI Features:**
- Employee autocomplete search (by name or ID)
- Certificate type dropdown (from templates)
- Signatory dropdown (optional)
- Preview button - shows certificate with data populated
- Generate PDF button - creates and downloads PDF
- Form validation
- Success/error notifications
- Preview dialog with rendered HTML

**Route Added:**
- `/certificates/generate` - Certificate generation page (requires certificate.generate permission)

## Acceptance Criteria Status

1. ✅ "Generate Certificate" page displays: employee search, certificate type dropdown, signatory dropdown
2. ✅ Employee search by ID or name, auto-complete suggestions displayed

8. ✅ "Generate PDF" button creates PDF file with certificate content
9. ✅ POST /api/certificates/generate endpoint creates certificate record and PDF file
10. ⚠️ PDF includes: government letterhead, certificate content, digital signature image (if configured), certificate reference number, QR code (optional) - **PARTIAL: No QR code, no digital signature image yet**
11. ✅ Generated PDF downloadable immediately, also saved to server storage
12. ❌ "Generate Word" button creates editable .docx file for customization - **DEFERRED**
13. ✅ Certificate generation logged to audit log and certificate issuance log

**Summary:** 10/13 fully implemented, 2 partially implemented, 1 deferred

## Known Limitations

1. **No QR Code:** QR code generation not implemented (can be added with qrcode library)
2. **No Digital Signature Image:** Digital signature images not yet integrated (Story 5.3)
3. **No Word Export:** .docx generation not implemented (would require docx library)
4. **Signatory Filter:** Lists all employees instead of filtering by role
5. **No Batch Generation:** Single certificate only (Story 5.5 will add batch)

---

## Testing Notes

**Manual Testing Required:**
1. Login as HR Administrator
2. Navigate to Certificates > Generate
3. Select an employee from autocomplete
4. Select a certificate type
5. Optionally select a signatory
6. Click "Preview Certificate" - verify data is populated correctly
7. Click "Generate PDF" - verify PDF is created and downloaded
8. Check `backend/certificates/` directory for saved PDF
9. Verify certificate record in database
10. Verify audit log entry

**Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM certificates ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE module = 'Certificate Management' AND action = 'CREATE';
```

**File System Verification:**
```bash
ls -la backend/certificates/
```
