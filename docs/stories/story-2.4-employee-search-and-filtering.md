3. ✅ Search results display in real-time (debounced after 300ms of typing)
4. ✅ Advanced filters panel includes: department (multi-select dropdown), employment status (multi-select), salary grade (range slider), date hired (date range picker)
5. ✅ "Apply Filters" button refreshes table with filtered results
6. ✅ "Clear Filters" button resets all filters and search
7. ✅ Filter state persists in URL query parameters (shareable filtered view)
8. ✅ Filtered results display count: "Showing X of Y employees"
9. ✅ Export filtered results to CSV via "Export" button
10. ✅ GET /api/employees endpoint supports query parameters: search, department_ids, employment_statuses, salary_grade_min, salary_grade_max, date_hired_from, date_hired_to
11. ✅ Supervisors see only employees in their department(s), HR admins see all employees
12. ✅ Search and filter actions do not require audit logging (read-only operations)
