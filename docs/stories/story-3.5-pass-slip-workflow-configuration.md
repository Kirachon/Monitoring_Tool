1. ✅ "Approval Workflows" page under system configuration displays list of departments
2. ✅ Each department row shows current workflow: number of approval levels, approvers per level

5. ✅ Each approval level specifies: approver role (Supervisor, Department Head, HR Admin), approval required (Yes/No)
6. ✅ Drag-and-drop interface to reorder approval levels
7. ✅ PUT /api/workflows/pass-slip/:department_id endpoint saves workflow configuration
8. ✅ Workflow changes apply to new pass slip requests only (existing requests follow original workflow)
