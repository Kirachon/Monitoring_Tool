---

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

**1. Leave Service (`backend/src/services/leaveService.js`)**
- Added `getPendingLeaveApprovals(supervisorId)` - Retrieves pending leave requests for supervisor's department employees with balance information
- Added `approveLeaveRequest(id, approverId, ipAddress, userAgent)` - Approves leave request, validates balance, deducts credits, updates approval record
- Added `denyLeaveRequest(id, approverId, denialReason, ipAddress, userAgent)` - Denies leave request with reason, updates approval record
- All methods use transactions for data integrity
- Full audit logging for all approval actions

**2. Leave Controller (`backend/src/controllers/leaveController.js`)**
- Added `getPendingApprovals()` - GET /api/leave/approvals/pending
- Added `approveLeaveRequest()` - PUT /api/leave/requests/:id/approve
- Added `denyLeaveRequest()` - PUT /api/leave/requests/:id/deny
- Validation for denial reason (minimum 10 characters)
- Error handling with appropriate status codes

**3. Leave Routes (`backend/src/routes/leave.js`)**
- Added GET /api/leave/approvals/pending (requires leave.approve permission)
- Added PUT /api/leave/requests/:id/approve (requires leave.approve permission)
- Added PUT /api/leave/requests/:id/deny (requires leave.approve permission)

### Frontend Changes

**1. Leave Approvals View (`frontend/src/views/LeaveApprovals.vue`)**
- Data table showing pending leave requests with:
  - Employee name and number
  - Leave type
  - Date range and duration
  - Current balance (color-coded: green if sufficient, red if insufficient)
  - Reason
  - Approve/Deny action buttons
- Approve button disabled if insufficient balance
- Deny dialog requiring reason (minimum 10 characters)
- Real-time count badge showing pending approvals
- Success/error notifications
- Refresh functionality

**2. Leave Service (`frontend/src/services/leaveService.js`)**
- Added `getPendingApprovals()` - Fetches pending leave approvals
- Added `approveLeaveRequest(id)` - Approves leave request
- Added `denyLeaveRequest(id, denialReason)` - Denies leave request with reason

**3. Router (`frontend/src/router/index.js`)**
- Added /leave/approvals route (requires leave.approve permission)

**4. Navigation Drawer (`frontend/src/components/NavigationDrawer.vue`)**
- Updated Approvals menu to be a group with sub-items:
  - Pass Slips (for pass slip approvals)
  - Leave Requests (for leave approvals)
- Pending count badge on parent menu item

## Database Changes

No new migrations required. Uses existing tables:
- `leave_requests` - Updated status, approved_by, approved_at, denial_reason
- `leave_balances` - Balance deducted on approval
- `approvals` - Status updated to Approved/Denied
- `audit_logs` - All approval actions logged

---

## Testing Notes

**Manual Testing Required:**
1. Login as supervisor
2. Navigate to Approvals → Leave Requests
3. Verify pending leave requests from department employees are displayed
4. Verify balance is displayed correctly
5. Test approve action (verify balance deduction)
6. Test deny action (verify reason requirement)
7. Verify notifications display correctly
8. Verify audit logs are created

**Edge Cases to Test:**
- Approve request with insufficient balance (should be disabled)
- Deny request with reason < 10 characters (should show validation error)
- Approve/deny already processed request (should show error)
- Supervisor trying to approve request from another department (should not appear in list)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Single-level approval only** - Multi-level approval workflow not implemented (deferred)
2. **No email notifications** - In-app notifications only (email system to be implemented in Priority 4)
3. **No attachment viewing** - Medical certificate/document viewing not implemented
4. **No department leave calendar** - Calendar view deferred to Story 4.5

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement Story 4.5: Leave Calendar and Conflict Detection
2. Implement Story 4.6: Leave Balance Tracking (real-time updates)
3. Implement email notification system (Priority 4)
4. Add multi-level approval workflow (if required)
