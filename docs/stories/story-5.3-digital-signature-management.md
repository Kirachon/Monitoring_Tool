**Epic:** 5 - Certificate Generation
**Story ID:** 5.3
**Story Type:** Feature Development
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Dependencies:** Story 5.2 (Certificate Generation)
**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## User Story

As a **HR administrator**,
I want **to upload and manage digital signatures for authorized signatories**,
so that **generated certificates include official signatures without manual signing**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ "Digital Signatures" page under system configuration lists all signatories with signature status (Uploaded/Not Uploaded)
2. ✅ "Upload Signature" button opens form with fields: signatory (employee dropdown), signature image (file upload), signature title (text input)
3. ✅ Signature image requirements: PNG format with transparent background, recommended size 300x100 pixels, max file size 500KB
4. ✅ POST /api/signatures endpoint uploads signature image, stores in secure directory, associates with employee record
5. ✅ Signature preview displayed after upload
6. ✅ "Replace Signature" button allows updating signature image
7. ✅ "Remove Signature" button deletes signature image (soft delete, historical certificates retain original signature)
8. ✅ Signature positioning configurable per template: X/Y coordinates, width/height
9. ✅ Certificate generation uses signatory's uploaded signature image if available
10. ✅ Certificates without digital signature display placeholder: "________________________" with signatory name below
11. ✅ Signature management actions logged to audit log
12. ✅ GET /api/signatures/:employee_id endpoint returns signature image for certificate generation
13. ✅ Signature images stored with access control (only HR admins can view/manage)
