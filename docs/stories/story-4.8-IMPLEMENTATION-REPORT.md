# Story 4.8: Leave Monetization Calculation - Implementation Report

## Overview
Implements computation and management of leave monetization for employees per CSC rules, including preview, save, history, and PDF report generation.

## Backend
- Migration: `leave_monetizations` table
- Service: `leaveMonetizationService` with `calculate`, `createRecord`, `listHistory`
- Controller: `leaveMonetizationController` with:
  - POST `/preview` → compute balances and totals (VL + SL) with 300 days cap
  - POST `/` → persist record with audit log
  - GET `/history?employeeId=...` → list records
  - GET `/:id/report` → generate PDF using Puppeteer
- Routes registered under `/api/leave-monetization`

## Frontend
- Service: `frontend/src/services/leaveMonetizationService.js` with `preview`, `create`, `history`, `downloadReport`
- View: `frontend/src/views/LeaveMonetization.vue`
  - Employee search (autocomplete)
  - Inputs: retirement date, daily rate
  - Actions: Preview, Save
  - Preview card displaying VL, SL, total days, daily rate, total amount
  - History tab with download (PDF) action
- Router: added `/leave/monetization` (permission: `leave.manage`)

## Security & Validation
- Requires authentication; endpoints guarded by `leave.manage`
- Validates required fields; server-side error handling and logging
- PDF generation sandbox flags enabled

## Testing Recommendations
- Unit: calculation caps (300 days), parsing of balances, rounding behavior
- Integration: create and fetch history; PDF endpoint returns a non-empty PDF
- UI/E2E: employee search, preview → save flow, history load, report download

## Status
✅ Completed. Acceptance criteria satisfied.
