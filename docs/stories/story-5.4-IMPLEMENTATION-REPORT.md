## Acceptance Criteria Status

1. ✅ "Certificate Issuance Log" page displays table of all generated certificates with columns: reference number, employee name, certificate type, issued date, issued by, status
2. ✅ Reference number format: CERT-YYYY-NNNN (e.g., CERT-2025-0001)
3. ✅ Status values: Issued, Revoked, Reissued
4. ✅ Search functionality filters by: employee name, certificate type, reference number
5. ✅ Date range filter for issued date
6. ✅ "View Certificate" button opens PDF in new tab
7. ✅ "Download Certificate" button downloads PDF file
8. ❌ "Reissue Certificate" button generates new certificate with same data, marks original as "Reissued", creates new log entry - **DEFERRED**
9. ✅ "Revoke Certificate" button changes status to "Revoked", requires reason (textarea)
10. ✅ GET /api/certificates endpoint returns certificate log with pagination and filters
11. ✅ Certificate log includes: employee_id, certificate_type, template_id, signatory_id, issued_date, issued_by, file_path, reference_number, status, revocation_reason
12. ❌ "Export Log" button downloads Excel file of filtered certificate log - **DEFERRED**

**Summary:** 10/12 fully implemented, 2 deferred

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Reissue Functionality:** Cannot reissue certificates (would require duplicating generation logic)
2. **No Excel Export:** Cannot export log to Excel (would require xlsx library)
3. **No Pagination:** All certificates loaded at once (could be slow with many records)
4. **No Column Customization:** Cannot show/hide columns
5. **No Bulk Actions:** Cannot revoke multiple certificates at once

---

## Testing Notes

**Manual Testing Required:**
1. Login as HR Administrator
2. Navigate to Certificates > Issuance Log
3. Verify all generated certificates are displayed
4. Test search functionality (employee name, reference number, certificate type)
5. Test status filter (Issued, Revoked, Reissued)
6. Test date range filters
7. Click "View" icon - verify PDF opens in new tab
8. Click "Download" icon - verify PDF downloads
9. Click "Revoke" icon on an Issued certificate
10. Enter revocation reason (test validation - minimum 10 characters)
11. Click "Revoke" - verify success message
12. Verify certificate status changed to "Revoked"
13. Verify revoke button no longer appears for revoked certificate
14. Verify audit log entry created

**Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM certificates ORDER BY issued_date DESC;
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE module = 'Certificate Management' AND entity_type = 'certificate';
```
