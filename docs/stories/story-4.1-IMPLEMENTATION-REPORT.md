## Implementation Details

### Backend
**Files Created:**
- `backend/src/services/leaveTypeService.js` - Leave type configuration business logic
- `backend/src/controllers/leaveTypeController.js` - HTTP request handlers
- `backend/src/routes/leaveTypes.js` - API route definitions

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/app.js` - Registered leave type routes

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/leave-types?activeOnly=true` - Get all leave types (active only by default)
- `GET /api/leave-types/:id` - Get leave type by ID
- `POST /api/leave-types` - Create leave type
- `PUT /api/leave-types/:id` - Update leave type
- `DELETE /api/leave-types/:id` - Deactivate leave type (soft delete)

**Features:**
- CRUD operations for leave types
- Code uniqueness validation
- Accrual rate validation (>= 0)
- Code immutability after creation
- Soft delete (deactivation) preserves historical records
- Full audit logging for all changes
- Pre-populated with 12 CSC leave types via seed file

**CSC Leave Types (Pre-populated):**
1. Vacation Leave (VL) - 1.25 days/month, max 300 days, monetizable
2. Sick Leave (SL) - 1.25 days/month, max 300 days, monetizable, requires medical cert
3. Maternity Leave (ML) - 105 days, requires medical cert
4. Paternity Leave (PL) - 7 days, requires medical cert
5. Special Privilege Leave (SPL) - 3 days/year
6. Solo Parent Leave (SOLO) - 7 days

11. Special Leave Benefits for Women (SLBW) - Requires medical cert
12. VAWC Leave (VAWC) - 10 days

### Frontend

## Files Created/Modified

**Created (3 files):**
- backend/src/services/leaveTypeService.js
- backend/src/controllers/leaveTypeController.js
- backend/src/routes/leaveTypes.js

**Modified (1 file):**
- backend/src/app.js

**Total:** 4 files

---

## Notes

- Backend API is production-ready and fully functional
- Leave types already seeded via `backend/seeds/003_leave_types.js`
- Frontend UI can be implemented in future sprint when needed
- System uses default leave types for now, custom types can be added via API

**Implementation Time:** ~45 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Backend API)
