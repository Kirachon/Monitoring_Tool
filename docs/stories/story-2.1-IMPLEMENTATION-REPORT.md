## 🔒 Security Features

- All endpoints protected by authentication middleware
- Create/Update require employee.write permission
- Delete requires employee.delete permission
- Audit logging of all actions

## 📊 Business Logic

**Hierarchy:**
- Unlimited nesting levels supported
- Parent-child relationships maintained
- Tree structure built recursively

**Validation:**
- Department name unique within parent (allows same name in different parents)
- Circular reference prevention (department cannot be its own ancestor)
- Cannot delete department with assigned employees

**Circular Reference Prevention:**
- Checks if new parent is a descendant of current department
- Traverses up the hierarchy to detect cycles
- Prevents infinite loops in tree structure
