# RBAC Restoration Report

## Summary
- **REVERTED (2025-10-08):** Navigation Drawer now hides menu items when users lack permission (using `v-if` conditionals) instead of showing them as disabled. This provides a cleaner, more professional user experience.
- Router guards and backend middleware continue to enforce access control at all layers.
- Verified logout button visibility and behavior in headed runs and via existing logout E2E tests; logout works across roles.
- Added visual smoke spec and debug tests to verify permission-based visibility.

## History

### Initial Issue (Phase 1)
- Multiple menu sections appeared hidden due to strict `v-if` permission checks combined with empty permissions arrays (database issue).
- When permissions were not hydrated or the `user_roles` table was empty, entire sections disappeared.

### Temporary Fix (Phase 2)
- Changed NavigationDrawer to show all items and disable those without permission (`:disabled` binding).
- This was intended to improve discoverability during manual testing.
- **Problem:** Created poor UX with many grayed-out items cluttering the navigation for users.

### Final Solution (Phase 3 - Current)
- **Reverted to hiding items** when users lack permission (using `v-if` conditionals).
- Fixed the root cause: Empty `user_roles` table in database (see RBAC-FIX-REPORT.md).
- Users now see only menu items relevant to their role.
- No grayed-out/disabled items cluttering the navigation drawer.

## Current Implementation

### Navigation Visibility Pattern
```vue
<!-- Items are completely hidden when user lacks permission -->
<v-list-item
  v-if="hasPermission('pass_slip.create')"
  prepend-icon="mdi-file-document"
  title="Pass Slips"
  to="/pass-slips"
/>

<!-- Sections are wrapped in templates with permission checks -->
<template v-if="canManageEmployees">
  <v-list-subheader>HR Management</v-list-subheader>
  <v-list-item ... />
</template>
```

### Expected Visibility Per Role

**Employee** sees ONLY:
- Dashboard
- Pass Slips
- Leave

**Supervisor** sees:
- Dashboard
- Pass Slips
- Leave
- Approvals (Pass Slips, Leave Requests)
- Reports (Pass Slips, Leave, Certificates, Employees)

**HR Administrator** sees:
- Everything Supervisor sees, PLUS:
- Departments
- Employees
- Certificates (Templates, Generate, Log, Signatures)

**System Administrator** sees:
- Everything (all menu items)

## Security Layers (All Enforced)
1. **Frontend UI**: Menu items hidden when lacking permission ✅
2. **Frontend Router**: Direct URL navigation blocked by router guards ✅
3. **Backend API**: API endpoints protected by permission middleware ✅

## Verifications
- Debug test: 4/4 passed ✅
  - Admin: All items visible
  - HR Admin: Pass Slips, Leave, Employees visible; User Management hidden
  - Supervisor: Pass Slips, Leave visible; Employees, User Management hidden
  - Employee: Pass Slips, Leave visible; Employees, User Management hidden
- Manual verification test: 4/4 passed ✅
- Visual smoke screenshots stored at `frontend/test-results/visual-*.png`
- User menu with Logout visible and functional for all roles ✅

## Benefits of Current Approach
- ✅ Clean, professional user interface
- ✅ Users see only relevant menu items for their role
- ✅ No visual clutter from disabled/grayed-out items
- ✅ Security maintained through router guards and API middleware
- ✅ Better user experience overall
