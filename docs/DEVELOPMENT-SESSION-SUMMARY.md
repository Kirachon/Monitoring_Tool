## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Test the implemented features:**
   - Login as supervisor
   - Test leave approval workflow
   - Verify balance deduction
   - Check audit logs

2. **Continue with Priority 2 stories:**
   - Implement Certificate Generation System (Stories 5.1-5.5)
   - Implement Reporting & Analytics (Stories 6.1-6.6)

3. **Implement email notification system** to complete the user experience

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Performance optimization** - Add database indexes for frequently queried tables
2. **Backup strategy** - Configure automated database backups
3. **Monitoring** - Set up application and database monitoring
4. **Security hardening** - SSL/TLS configuration, rate limiting, etc.
5. **Mobile responsiveness** - Test and optimize for mobile devices
