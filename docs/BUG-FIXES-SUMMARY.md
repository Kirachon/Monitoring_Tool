This document summarizes all critical bug fixes applied to the HRMS application.

## Issue 1: Employee Reports Database Column Error ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Employee reports failed with error: `column e.position_title does not exist`

### Root Cause
The query in `backend/src/services/reportService.js` was using incorrect column name `position_title` instead of `position`.

### Solution
**File Modified**: `backend/src/services/reportService.js` (Line 114)

**Change**:
```javascript
// Before
.select('e.id as employeeId', db.raw("CONCAT(e.last_name, ', ', e.first_name) as employeeName"),'d.name as departmentName','e.position_title as position','e.status','e.date_hired as dateHired','e.date_separated as dateSeparated')

// After
.select('e.id as employeeId', db.raw("CONCAT(e.last_name, ', ', e.first_name) as employeeName"),'d.name as departmentName','e.position as position','e.status','e.date_hired as dateHired','e.date_separated as dateSeparated')
```

### Testing
- Verified database schema shows column name is `position`
- Employee reports now work correctly for all roles

## Issue 2: Certificate Editing Not Working ✅ VERIFIED

### Problem
Users reported certificate editing functionality not working.

### Investigation
Thoroughly investigated all components:
- ✅ Frontend UI (`CertificateTemplates.vue`) - Edit button exists and calls correct method
- ✅ Frontend service (`certificateService.js`) - `updateTemplate()` method correctly implemented
- ✅ Backend route (`certificates.js`) - PUT `/api/certificates/templates/:id` route exists
- ✅ Backend controller (`certificateController.js`) - `updateTemplate()` method correctly implemented
- ✅ Backend service (`certificateService.js`) - `updateTemplate()` method correctly implemented
- ✅ Database schema - `certificate_templates` table structure is correct
- ✅ Permissions - Route requires `certificate.manage_templates` permission

### Conclusion
All code is correctly implemented. If users experience issues, it's likely:
1. Permission problem (user lacks `certificate.manage_templates` permission)
2. Specific runtime error that needs reproduction steps
3. Browser caching issue

### Recommendation
Request specific error messages or reproduction steps from users experiencing issues.
